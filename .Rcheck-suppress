# R CMD check suppressions
# 
# The following warning is expected in corporate/restricted network environments:
# "Warning: unable to access index for repository https://CRAN.R-project.org/src/contrib"
#
# This occurs when checking for unstated dependencies in 'tests' but does not
# indicate a code problem. All test dependencies are properly declared in DESCRIPTION.
#
# To run check without network dependency verification:
# Sys.setenv("_R_CHECK_CRAN_INCOMING_REMOTE_" = "FALSE")
# devtools::check()
