This dashboard provides a data-driven approach to support the assessment of governance-related CPIA criteria (Questions 12-16). Using publicly available data sources, the dashboard generates evidence-based score estimates for each criterion to inform and support professional judgment in the scoring process.

#### Purpose

This tool assists governance specialists in developing CPIA scores by providing objective, data-driven estimates. The dashboard synthesizes multiple data sources to deliver:

- **Evidence-based estimates** for governance-related criteria
- **Transparent methodology** documenting score derivation
- **Comparative context** across countries and time periods
- **Supporting documentation** to substantiate scoring decisions

The dashboard complements technical expertise by providing an analytical foundation for the scoring process, promoting consistency and defensibility in country assessments. **Please note: The estimates presented are data-driven suggestions derived from publicly available sources. As with all datasets, inherent limitations exist. Exercise professional judgment and use these estimates as supporting evidence rather than definitive scores.**

#### Dashboard Structure

The dashboard comprises the following sections:

##### 1. Visualizations
This section presents governance performance indicators and estimated scores across the five governance criteria (Questions 12a-16d). Users may select a specific criterion of interest, designate a target country, and identify comparator groupings for benchmarking analysis. The interface also enables comparison of historical actual CPIA scores against data-driven estimates through tabular displays.

##### 2. Code
This work is fully open-source. Users are encouraged to access the linked repositories to review the methodological implementation and underlying analytical framework in detail.
